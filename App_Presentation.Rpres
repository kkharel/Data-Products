Background
========================================================

Let us all learn Monte-Carlo Methods with visualization

- Many people struggle to understand different mathematical concepts just by looking at the notations
- It gets hard to make a picture in head
- Not anymore, we can visualize the mathematical working behind the scenes using R

How to use the App
========================================================

- We can slide the slider on Nsim to generate as many random variables as we want
- We can slide the rate parameter to adjust lambda
- We generate our own data and transform it to get the targeted random variables
- Complile both ui.R and server.R and see the magic happen

Data
========================================================

- We generate random data from uniform distribution
- We transform this random variables to get exponential random variables

Plot
========================================================
- The plot in the app represents Uniform distribution, built-in exponential distribution from R and how it compares to transformed exponential distribution that we generated by transforming random variables.
