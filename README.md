# This application lets the user to interact with the mathematical concept of inverse transform method.

# User can change the number of simulations and rate parameter to see how we can generate the targeted distribution from sampling uniform random variables from uniform distribution

# Select the number of simulations, also select the rate parameter if to see how simulations change with increasing rate and increasing simulations.
