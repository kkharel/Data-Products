Email: kkharel@uci.edu if you have any questions on codes and development

The application lets the user to interact with the mathematical concept of inverse transform method.

User can change the number of simulations and rate parameter to see how we can generate the targeted distribution from sampling uniform random variables from uniform distribution

Select the number of simulations, also select the rate parameter if to see how simulations change with increasing rate and increasing simulations
